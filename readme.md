# Project Title: Home equity value empowered housing marketplace

In this document, we present all the activities we carried out while developing a project “Home equity coin empowered housing marketplace”. We mainly worked to develop linear regression model to predict housing price which is then used to calculate home equity value.

### Project Description:
The current housing marketplace policy and practice has brought considerable insecurities to most house owners particularly those with no money at hand. The price of houses is governed by several factors. Sometimes, the property tax rises so sharply that it becomes extremely hard for the house owners to pay the yearly tax. In such a situation, owners will have the option either to sell the property and leave the place and neighbourhood or apply for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay the tax. The first option is not as easy as it sounds. The owner may not only need to leave a good neighbourhood, a good school for the children but also may leave the current job. However, for the low-income owners, the second option might not be even an option. For the owners who pay tax using HELOC, if they could not pay the bill for the credit in time, they are likely to be charged with interest, and further, it might impact their credit score too. 
So, the “Home equity coin empowered housing marketplace” project considers all the raised issues and incorporates the digital currency concept (equity coin) to provide a flexible but effective financial option for house owners. House owners can generate digital coins based on the house equity value and use the coins as an equivalent of cash to pay property tax and others. Further, the equity coin will not depend on the credit score and neighbourhood. The proposed project has the potential to transform the existing housing marketplace not only by benefitting the house owners but also benefitting other stakeholders including the community as well. 

### Project Goals:
The tentative goals of the intended project are as follows:

1. To identify the major issues with the current housing marketplace.

2. To assess the potential of incorporating the equity coin concept.

3. To apply the equity coin on top of the housing marketplace.

## User Audience Analysis and User Personas
#### User Group List:
Incorporating the equity coin is likely to add a few user groups to the existing housing marketplace. The potential user groups for the project are: 

* House Owners - Existing house owner who can sell a house
* Buyers - Potential owner 
* System Administrator - Person who maintains the house marketplace system and audits the behaviour of all users
* Community Representative - A person who manages donations received from the proposed system

#### User Matrix for Home equity coin empowered housing marketplace
The following table shows probable user groups for the proposed system and their knowledge, experience, skills, software experience, and frequency of use.
